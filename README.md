## Questions game

Simple Javascript Questions game that randomly selects questions from a list and displays them to the player in a prompt.

* Questions keep getting displayed until the user clicks on the "cancel" button
* The game makes sure that the same question is never displayed twice in a row
* The game keeps track of the score (number of correct answers during the current game)
* Encapsulation is done through the use of an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
